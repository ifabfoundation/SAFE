Graph-Based Anomaly Detection
==============================
Time series to network transformation via Visibility Graphs (NVG/HVG),
followed by graph-theoretic anomaly detection methods:
- OddBall algorithm (CliqueStar, HeavyVicinity, DominantPair)
- Community detection (temporal, via PyIOmica)
- Centrality analysis (degree, betweenness, closeness)
- Multiplex network analysis
